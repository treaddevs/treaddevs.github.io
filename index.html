<!-- Add an index.html file that introduces you to the rest of the class. You started this in the 1st class...
This will be the first draft of your own "biography page" -- like the one in the reading.
It should contain only information that you're okay with sharing publicly.
At a minimum, include your name and a fun fact about yourself.
NO STYLING NECESSARY -- You don't need to use any CSS, just the text.
When you're done, submit the URL for this repo (i.e., your github-classroom repo) in Canvas. -->

    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Sam Treadwell. I grew up in the Burlington, Vermont area and moved to Portland, Maine in 2022 
    to join the campus community after being accepted into Northeastern University's Align CS program (MSCS). 
    Midway through the Fall semester and over Winter break I learned a lot of web development concepts from an online course on Udemy:</p>

        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" alt="The Complete Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy">The Complete Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy</a>
    </p>
    <p id="monterrsat">Web Development skills I've learned so far:</p>
    <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap)</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>The Document Object Model (DOM)</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
    <p>Outside of the classroom I love all things outdoors. 
        From hiking, beach days, sailing, snowboarding, and mountain biking. I also like going to concerts, museums, and festivals. I'm alway down for an adventure and love getting out and exploring outside.</p>
    <p>FUN FACT:</p>
    <p>I've stretched out the ski season on the East Coast from October to July. (My goal is to make it every month of the year!)</p>
